Zathura A Space Adventure is a movie that was really important for my child hood, i remember watching it at least more that 10 times because it was constantly played in Disney XD, i watch it completely every time it was on, because was a really fun movie, it combined drama, space and fun situations.

This movie follows the two brothers, Walter and Danny, who don't get along, mimicking this adversity that a lot of siblings have. One afternoon, during their father's absence, they discover an old board game hidden in the basement: Zathura. As soon as they start playing, the game comes to life, small meteorites start raining down, and then the house starts moving, then they realize they are now in space, is a really fun way to start a movie.

This is like a parallel with the other movie Jumaji, the premise is really similar, a board game that alters reality, and the only way to get out is by finishing the game, and in other aspects is really similar.
Also they have a lot of fun and thrilling encounters, one of the most important being the random astronaut that shows up, appearing to know .a lot about the game, is not till later in the movie that we realize that he is actually Danny from the future, that ended up stuck in the game because he lost his brother, and because all players had to play, he could scape Zathura, for a child movie, it was really disturbing, at least for me, imagining being trapped in a place like that, all alone.

Thanks to this astronaut they are able to evade the “Zorgons” for a while, turning off the heat of the house and lighting a sofa up to serve as a decoy for them, but one of the brothers leaves the thermostat on, making the zorgons find them a start attacking them, destroying and burning all they could of the house.
Also they had this toy robot that was attacking them, to help them with the Zorgon, being this chaotic mashup of things happening, in the middle of all of these they manage to finish the game, making a black hole appear, sucking in the house, them, and all the ships of the Zorgon, giving a chilling scene when one of the brothers thinks they lost there other brother to the black hole only to wake up early that day in their house, like nothing happened.

One detail is that at the end, when everything appears to have been only the imagination, a bike falls down the sky leaving the question if everything was real.
Another fun fact, for the movie production they actually used practical effects, using scale toys, and other effects to make the movie timeless, if you watch this movie right now, you can tell the special effects don't look that old for the time it was released.

Overall, I know that for a lot of us, this movie was a big part of our childhood, a fun must-watch every time it showed up on TV. At least for me, it has a special place in my memories. I watched it so many times that I practically knew every scene, and even today it still feels just as fun and imaginative as when I was a kid. Zathura mixes adventure, chaos, drama, space and humor in a way that stays with you, and even though it’s a simple story, it has a lot of heart behind it.
