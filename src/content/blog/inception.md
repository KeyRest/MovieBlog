# Inception

Inception is a mind-bending thriller that explores the nature of dreams and reality. Christopher Nolan delivers a visually stunning and intellectually stimulating film.

## The Plot

Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable.

## Visuals

The practical effects and CGI are seamlessly blended to create a world where cities fold onto themselves and gravity is a suggestion.
