To make a little resume about the story, the nightmare before Christmas is one of my favorite movies in all times, I have been watching it over and over again since I was a kid, I have seen it so many times both in Spanish in English that I know songs and dialogues both in Spanish in English.

The story goes like this Jack Skellington, the pumpkin king, a skeleton who rule Halloween town, he is tired of Halloween, he’s tired of doing everything over and over and over again. One night after he walked a lot all night, he gets to a place he have never seen before a circle formed by trees. He gets close to one that has a Christmas tree on the door, when he opens the door, he falls into Christmas town a place that it’s full of light, sweet smells and a warmth he has never felt before, he end up being captivated by Christmas, in his arrogance and in his loneliness, he decides to steal Christmas and become the new Santa Claus.

Like I said before I love this movie for a million of reasons, there is a lot of things about this movie that I really enjoyed like the technique it was used to be created, stop motion, the fact that is creator is one of my favorites directors, Tim Burton, the way they use the stop motion to create something from scratch. They created something from a poem, a lot of people don’t know that the nightmare before Christmas was created from a poem that Tim Burton made in seconds.

This movie has a lot of amazing and unique characters, not just being Sally or Jack. Actually my favorite character It’s Zero, the Phantom dog of Jack, he’s so cute and sill, I just love every time he appears in the screen he definitely put something funny on the story. 

Something curious about the story is that originally Oogie boogie wasn’t going to be the bad guy, actually the bad guy was going to be Dr. Finkelstein dress in a costume of Oogie boogie, but Tim Burton hated this idea so much that he punched a hole in the wall, so they created Oogie boogie as the new antagonist of Halloween town.

Going to more curious facts about the story and spoiler alert.

Sally’s character is one with a fascinating backstory because in the book, yes this movie has books and It actually even have a video game and a little after final where Santa Claus goes to Halloween town many years after. But going back to the book,  it’s called long live the pumpkin queen and in book is revealed that Sally it’s not from Halloween town she’s actually from dream town. What happened was that the doctor Dr.Finkelstein kidnap her as a baby and he replaced her cotton stuffing with leaves so he could say the lie that he created her. This is so amazing to see because even though Sally looks like something that will be in Halloween town she always felt so curious about everything, she wanted to know even more about the surroundings, she was restless.

Jack is an amazing character too, he is showed to be sad, depressed, and lonely but after he finds Christmas town it’s like his spirit finally got up. It also show us the term of, curiosity killed the cat, in he’s wish to be the new Santa Claus, Jack ends up hurting a lot of children, in his arrogance and desire to possess Christmas and make his own he traumatized innocence kids. After his shoot and falls in a grave realizes that he is wrong. He is the pumpkin king, he just had to find the spark on the thing he already love he doesn’t need to change to be loved by others, he can’t  steal something just because he like it, he realizes that he tried his best and even if he failed, he did it and accepting his identity as the pumpkin king and being proud of who he is, he goes back to hallowing town to safe Santa Claus.

One of the most interesting parts of the nightmare before Christmas universe its a pretty short after ending about Santa Claus visiting Halloween town after many years, on this after ending he explains that after what happened, all the festive days started to get together and now the know each other‘s names, one day he decides to visit Halloween town again, finding the jack and Sally had five kids. Santa Claus being curious ask Jack “answer me honestly jack, knowing what you know now would you do it all over again?” and Jack funny enough been the pumpkin king he is, answers, “wouldn’t you?”
I love the music on this movie. It’s just so unique. My favorite songs will probably be Jack’s lament and the song on the end, meant to be, the song Jack and they sing together on the end. Those two songs are my favorite ones in all the movie Because they’re so deep and lovely.

The finally message on the movie, in my opinion, is to accept ourselves as we are, we don’t need to change to be like other, we can take things just because we like them, we can accept ourselves as we are.
Overall nightmare before Christmas is an amazing movie to watch, not just for the technique, the story, the characters, the music or the message.
