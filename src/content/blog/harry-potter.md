When I was a girl my mom showed me the Harry Potter movies and i simply loved themthe first two. These films mean a lot to me because they're not only full of magic and adventure but also show how someone can completely change their life when they discover who they really are and when they find true friends.

The story starts with Harry Potter, a boy who lives a sad life with his aunt and uncle who don't care about him much at all.One day he gets a mysterious letter telling him that he's a wizard and can go study at Hogwarts, a magical school. When I first saw this it made me dream about what it would be like if I got a letter like that and could go to a place full of magic, meet new friends, and learn amazing things. I think a lot of kids have wished for something magical like that.

In The Sorcerer's Stone everything is new for Harry. He learns that his parents died when he was just a baby because of a dark wizard named Voldemort. Even though it's sad Harry makes new friends at Hogwarts,Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger who become very important to him. They go on all kinds of adventures together and what I love most about this movie is how they always help each other. They learn about potions, play Quidditch, explore the castle and slowly discover that friendship and courage really do matter when you face problems.

The second movie, The Chamber of Secrets feels much darker right from the start. Strange things happen at Hogwarts students get petrified and there are rumors about a monster hiding somewhere in the school. Everyone is scared but what I like about Harry, Ron, and Hermione is that they don't just sit and wait, they decide to investigate and try to figure out the secrets of Hogwarts and Voldemort's past. I really like how they become even braver and more curious, it makes me want to be brave myself even when things are hard or scary.

My favorite scene in The Chamber of Secrets is when Harry is trapped and Fawkes, the phoenix, flies in to help him. I think this moment is so touching because Harry is hurt and completely alone, yet Fawkes appears to help and his tears end up healing Harry. To me
this scene is about hope,it makes me feel that help can come even when you least expect it and that being loyal and kind towards others really matters. It's also a reminder that sometimes, magical things can happen when we need them most.

I also love reading Harry Potter fan theories online, some people say that Dumbledore planned everything from the beginning to prepare Harry to fight Voldemort, others think Fawkes is connected to Dumbledore's soul or magic. There's even a theory that Hagrid knew more about the Chamber of Secrets than he let on but kept quiet to protect the school. I enjoy thinking about these ideas because they make the story feel even deeper and filled with mystery.

Overall, I think the first two Harry Potter movies are wonderful. They don't just have magic and suspense, they also teach important lessons about friendship, courage, and never giving up. Every time I watch them I feel like I'm stepping into a world where anything is possible and it makes me feel hopeful and inspired even long after the movie ends.

Now I want to talk about three Harry Potter movies. They are Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. These movies are very important in the story and I enjoy them for different reasons. When I watch them I feel many emotions like excitement, sadness and curiosity and that is why I like talking about them.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is one of my favorite movies from the Harry Potter movies. In this movie Harry joins the Triwizard Tournament. He does not want to join but the Goblet chooses him, I like the part with the dragon because it is very intense and fun to watch, I also like the Yule Ball because we see the characters acting like normal teenagers. They feel shy and nervous and it is nice to see this side of them, the end of the movie is a little sad because Voldemort returns and Cedric dies, this part is very important because everything changes after this moment

The Prisoner of Azkaban is also a movie I like a lot. This movie feels more dark and mysterious and I enjoy this feeling. I like when Harry meets Sirius Black. At the start everyone thinks Sirius is dangerous but later we learn the truth and we see that Sirius cares about Harry. This makes the story very emotional because Harry finally finds someone who feels like family. I also enjoy the part with time travel because it is cool to see Harry and Hermione working together and saving Buckbeak. It is interesting to watch the same scenes from two different moments in time.

The Dementors are very scary in this movie and they make the story feel more serious. They represent fear and sadness and they make Harry remember bad memories. Harry learns the Patronus charm to protect himself and this moment is very emotional and I like it a lot because it shows that Harry can be strong even when he feels afraid. The movie also has beautiful scenes like the ones with the Hogwarts bridge and the night sky which makes the movie feel magical even when the story is dark.

When I compare both movies I think they are special in different ways, The Prisoner of Azkaban is more mysterious and emotional and The Goblet of Fire has more action and surprises, in both movies Harry is growing up and learning many things, I also like the friendship between Harry Ron and Hermione, even if they fight sometimes they always stay together and help each other

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix continues the darker story that started in the last movies. In this movie Harry feels alone because many people do not believe him when he says that Voldemort is back this makes Harry feel frustrated and angry and we see a different side of him, I like this movie because we see Harry becoming a leader, the movie is sad too because Harry loses Sirius and this moment hurts him a lot, but it also makes him understand that he has friends and people who care about him and that he is not alone.

In general I think all three movies are very good and important in the Harry Potter story, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has a lot of action and moments that stay in your memory. And also Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is very special because it shows the value of trust, family and courage and it teaches that things are not always what they seem. And Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix shows how Harry grows stronger even when life becomes difficult and how friendship can help in dark times. These movies are exciting, emotional and magical and I enjoy watching them many times.
