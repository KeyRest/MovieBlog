### By Keiron Garro ###

Scary Movie 2 is a comedy that makes fun of popular horror films. The story starts when a group of college friends accepts an invitation to spend a weekend in an old, strange house owned by their Professor. 

At first, the friends think they will have a fun and relaxing time, but soon they realize that the house is full of weird things. Things that are supposed to be really scary are silly and made to be funny.

The movie parodies scenes from movies like The Exorcist and Poltergeist. 

The main characters are Cindy who is smart and brave, Brenda who is very funny, and Shorty who is the funniest of all.

Everything that happens is exaggerated to create humor, and the way the characters react is often silly and unexpected.

The character of Professor Oldman adds to the comedy because he plans to scare the group, but his actions are more strange and ridiculous than evil. 

I liked how the movie made fun of horror movie clichés, like how characters often make bad choices such as going into dark rooms alone or ignoring obvious dangers
